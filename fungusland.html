      <h1>FUNGUSLAND</h1>
    </center>
    <p>Fungusland is an experimental game made using Processing.</p>
    <p>              </p>
    <p>The objective in Fungusland is to keep exploring a small place. The game works like a mantra of transformation, in which each five laps see the player's world shifting. The game might lag sometimes, so please, be patient. Every glitch is <b>intentional</b>, and I hope that you enjoy this experience.</p>
